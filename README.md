# UniTask
This is a web application based on the MVC structure, to help organize your tasks related to University classes and semesters. The repository contains the source code of the application, which runs properly in a Chrome Web Browser, but the original application was designed to run in a desktop by using the Electron framework.

The application is working, but isn't compeltelty finished yet. There are some changes that I'm planning to make.
